#example of setting up a an ssh-agent.

#note i am using rhel as my os.



#first start the agent
this will start the agent and store its pid and and ssh authentication socket in your shell env variables

eval $(ssh-agent)


#now we need to add our private keys

#you will be prompted to enter your passphrase so you can store your key in the agent
ssh-add
# or
ssh-add private-key

#list of available keys in the agent
ssh-add -l

#now you can use ssh without entering the passphrase evrytime or exposing your private key in the memory

ssh user@192.2.2.2
